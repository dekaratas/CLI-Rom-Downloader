# cli-rom-downloader using TypeScript (WIP)
A first foray into actually creating something I would use myself.

It's pretty much what the name implies. Makes downloading ROMs a bit easier (except that using multiple keywords for specific game searches don't work yet).
Opening up a console's library and scrolling to the ROM you want does work tho, as well as showing download progress/download speed.

More to come (as well as a proper readme I suppose...)
